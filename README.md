# Book Recommender

A semantic book recommender built with LangChain, Hugging Face, and Gradio. This project allows users to find book recommendations based on a textual description, a specific category, and an emotional tone.

## Project Structure

  - `BookRecommender/`: The main project folder.
      - `data-exploration.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook for initial data analysis and exploration.
      - `vector_search.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to use vector search for semantic book recommendations.
      - `text_classification.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook for the text classification part of the project.
      - `sentiment_analysis.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook focused on sentiment analysis to determine the emotional tone of book descriptions.
      - `books_cleaned.csv`: Cleaned version of the raw book data.
      - `books_with_categories.csv`: The book dataset with assigned categories after classification.
      - `books_with_emotions.csv`: The final dataset used by the application, including emotional tone scores.
      - `tagged_description.txt`: A text file containing book descriptions formatted for processing by the LangChain document loader.
      - `gradio-dashboard.py`: The Python script that runs the Gradio user interface for the book recommender.
      - `cover-not-found.png`: A placeholder image for books without a cover thumbnail.

## Features

  - **Semantic Search**: Uses a Hugging Face sentence-transformer model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to perform semantic similarity searches on book descriptions.
  - **Filtering**: Users can filter recommendations by `category` and `emotional tone` (Happy, Surprising, Angry, Suspenseful, Sad).
  - **Interactive UI**: A user-friendly web interface built with Gradio for easy interaction.
  - **Efficient Retrieval**: The vector store (`Chroma`) provides an efficient way to handle a large number of book descriptions for quick retrieval.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KyawtEaindrayWin912/BookRecommender.git
    cd BookRecommender
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries**:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy python-dotenv langchain langchain-huggingface langchain-chroma gradio
    ```

4.  **Prepare the data**:

      - The `books_cleaned.csv`, `books_with_categories.csv`, `books_with_emotions.csv`, and `tagged_description.txt` files are generated by running the Jupyter notebooks. Ensure these files are in the project's root directory.

## How to Run

To start the Gradio web interface, run the following command from the `BookRecommender` directory:

```bash
python gradio-dashboard.py
```

This will launch the dashboard, and you can access it via the local URL provided in the terminal output (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:7860`).

-----

## Usage

1.  Open the web interface in your browser.
2.  Enter a description of the book you want to find in the `Please enter a description of a book:` textbox.
3.  Optionally, select a `category` and `emotional tone` from the dropdown menus to narrow down the results.
4.  Click the `Find recommendations` button to see a gallery of suggested books.
